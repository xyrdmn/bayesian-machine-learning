    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, we often use parametric models $p(\\mathbf{y} \\lvert \\mathbf{X},\\boldsymbol\\theta)$ to explain data and infer optimal values of parameter $\\boldsymbol\\theta$ via [maximum likelihood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_likelihood_estimation) or [maximum a posteriori](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_a_posteriori) estimation. If needed we can also infer a full [posterior distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posterior_probability) $p(\\boldsymbol\\theta \\lvert \\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{y})$ instead of a point estimate $\\boldsymbol{\\hat\\theta}$. With increasing data complexity, models with a higher number of parameters are usually needed to explain data reasonably well. Methods that use models with a fixed number of parameters are called parametric methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "In non-parametric methods, on the other hand, the number of parameters depend on the dataset size. For example, in [Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_regression), a weight $w_i$ is assigned to each observed target $y_i$ and for predicting the target value at a new point $\\mathbf{x}$ a weighted average is computed: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(\\mathbf{x}) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_i(\\mathbf{x})y_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w_i(\\mathbf{x}) = \\frac{\\kappa(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}_{i})}{\\sum_{i'=1}^{N}\\kappa(\\mathbf{x}, \\mathbf{x}_{i'})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Observations that are closer to $\\mathbf{x}$ have a higher weight than observations that are further away. Weights are computed from $\\mathbf{x}$ and observed $\\mathbf{x}_i$ with a kernel $\\kappa$. A special case is k-nearest neighbors (KNN) where the $k$ closest observations have a weight $1/k$, and all others have weight $0$. Non-parametric methods often need to process all training data for prediction and are therefore slower at inference time than parametric methods. On the other hand, training is usually faster as non-parametric models only need to remember training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another example of non-parametric methods are [Gaussian processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process) (GPs). Instead of inferring a distribution over the parameters of a parametric function Gaussian processes can be used to infer a distribution over functions directly. A Gaussian process defines a prior over functions. After having observed some function values it can be converted into a posterior over functions. Inference of continuous function values in this context is known as GP regression but GPs can also be used for classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "A Gaussian process is a [random process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process) where any point $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is assigned a random variable $f(\\mathbf{x})$ and where the joint distribution of a finite number of these variables $p(f(\\mathbf{x}_1),...,f(\\mathbf{x}_N))$ is itself Gaussian:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(\\mathbf{f} \\lvert \\mathbf{X}) = \\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{f} \\lvert \\boldsymbol\\mu, \\mathbf{K})\\tag{1}\\label{eq1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In Equation $(1)$, $\\mathbf{f} = (f(\\mathbf{x}_1),...,f(\\mathbf{x}_N))$, $\\boldsymbol\\mu = (m(\\mathbf{x}_1),...,m(\\mathbf{x}_N))$ and $K_{ij} = \\kappa(\\mathbf{x}_i,\\mathbf{x}_j)$. $m$ is the mean function and it is common to use $m(\\mathbf{x}) = 0$ as GPs are flexible enough to model the mean arbitrarily well. $\\kappa$ is a positive definite *kernel function* or *covariance function*. Thus, a Gaussian process is a distribution over functions whose shape (smoothness, ...) is defined by $\\mathbf{K}$. If points $\\mathbf{x}_i$ and $\\mathbf{x}_j$ are considered to be similar by the kernel the function values at these points, $f(\\mathbf{x}_i)$ and $f(\\mathbf{x}_j)$, can be expected to be similar too. \n",
    "\n",
    "A GP prior $p(\\mathbf{f} \\lvert \\mathbf{X})$ can be converted into a GP posterior $p(\\mathbf{f} \\lvert \\mathbf{X},\\mathbf{y})$ after having observed some data $\\mathbf{y}$. The posterior can then be used to make predictions $\\mathbf{f}_*$ given new input $\\mathbf{X}_*$:\n",

It can be configured with [pre-defined kernels and user-defined kernels](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/gaussian_process.html#gp-kernels). Kernels can also be composed. The squared exponential kernel is the `RBF` kernel in scikit-learn. The `RBF` kernel only has a `length_scale` parameter which corresponds to the $l$ parameter above. To have a $\\sigma_f$ parameter as well, we have to compose the `RBF` kernel with a `ConstantKernel`."
